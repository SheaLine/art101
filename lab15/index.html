          <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to find an API and use AJAX to get the
            data provided by the API, then print it out on our website.

        <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I didn't have a lot of problems with this lab because the code was
            given to us. The hardest part for me was finding an free API that
            was easy enough to use.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">

          <p>
            I enjoyed this lab. It wasn't too hard for me because we were given
            the code. I have worked with APIs before, but never with jquery. It
            was an interesting lab!

            Oh no you decided hang out with your friends instead of do your
            work!! It's okay every problem can be fixed with a good excuse.
