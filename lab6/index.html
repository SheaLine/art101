            This lab was pretty easy because it was very similar to lab 5. Instead of just printing the text we put the text into an object and an array and printed the data that was stored in those structures. One of the problems that I had was when I first pushed my code to github, my css wasn’t loaded. I went back to see if there was something wrong with my code, but I didn’t see an error. I then went back to my page and refreshed it and the css loaded na the page looked as it did locally.
