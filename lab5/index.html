          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            In this lab we created variables in Javascript then learned how to
            print the variables to our webpage.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest problem I hade was figuring out where I wanted to put
            the picture of my truck to make the page look nice.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This lab was pretty straight forward for me. The biggest thing that
            I learned is the document.writeln command because in my experience
            with web development we used tools like react to manipulate the DOM.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            This is the page that I created for lab 5. Below is the output of
            the JavaScript.
          </p>
          <div id="output">
            <h3>Script Output</h3>
            <script src="js/lab.js"></script>

          <div>
            <h3 id="truck-heading">Here is my truck!</h3>
            <img src="img/truck.png" id="truck" alt="picture of car" />
