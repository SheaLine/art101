          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to create a file structure for all the
            labs in this class. We then needed to link to all of these labs on
            our homepage and provide screenshots of the process on this page.

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            This biggest problem that arose for me was getting a good internet
            connection as I am doing this lab at a cafe at a museum in Paris,
            everything else was pretty straightforward.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I think that this lab went pretty well. I was familiar with an
            organized file structure already and it helped that Wes already gave
            us a working one. I was also able put the images on this page fairly
            easily because I decided to add an image last lab. Centering the
            screenshots and the captions was a lot easier in this lab then when
            I tried to do it last lab because I already had that experience last
            time.
