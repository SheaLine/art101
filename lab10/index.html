            The challenge of this lab was creating a button that generated
            random text and outputting it to our webpage.

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest problem that I had was dealing with CSS and trying to
            center my text input, send, and get response buttons. This is always
            an issue for me because flex-boxes are confusing to me. I figured it
            our through trial and error.

        <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This lab wasn't too hard, it took a little more time than usual to
            figure out the css of my messaging system and how to get the input
            of the input box. Other than that it was more of the same as the
            other labs.
