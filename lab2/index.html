            My name is Shea Line and I am from a town called Windsor which is
            about an hour north of San Francisco. I am a 4th year Computer
            Science: Game Design major. I have a good amount of experience in
            programming, and I am taking this class to learn more about creative
            ways to code. In my free time, I like to hang out with my friends
            and girlfriend, play basketball or golf, snowboard, and be in the
            outdoors.

            My partner's name is Madison Grace Noble De La Merced, but she goes
            by Madison or Mads. She is a second year at UCSC majoring in Film
            and Digital Media. She doesn't have a whole lot of experience with
            programming, but she is optimistic and looking forward to learning
            more about how to use computers to create art.
