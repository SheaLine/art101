          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to use if statements to print out a
            value based on an input.

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I didn't have any problems with this lab. Everything pretty much
            worked first try and it was a smooth and fun process.

            I really enjoyed this lab. I felt like going above and beyond this
            time because I am struggling with my code in another class and
            wanted to feel a little better about my skills. I first did the base
            part of the lab and it only took about 10 minutes. So I then got
            inspiration from Wes's website and decided to use the same assets
            for the hat and thought bubble. Once I got the front end looking
            good, I used the same base logic from task 2 to get the bubble
            showing up when its supposed to. Once that was working I added the
            house array and got rid of the if statements. I then finally added
            the recommended hash function to make the sorting more interesting.
            I am happy with how this turned out because it didn't make me feel
            stupid like other projects can and I love Harry Potter!!
