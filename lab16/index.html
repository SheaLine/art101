          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to use AJAX to retrieve a comic from
            an API and output the comic to our website.

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest problem I had was I was getting CORS errors when trying
            to hit the endpoint. I searched online for solutions to this problem
            and I found a public CORS bypass proxy. I just needed to prepend the
            URL for that proxy to the API endpoint URL to bypass the CORS error.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I enjoyed this lab. I think that It has helped with my understanding
            of APIs. Understanding of APIs is pivotal to any programer, so this
            is a good foundation to build on. I think if I had a little more
            time I would add a number input box that would allow the user to
            input what number comic they want to go to. This way they wouldn't
            have to spam the prev or next buttons.
