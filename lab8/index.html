          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge with this lab was working with anonymous functions and
            callbacks by mapping a mathematical function to an array and logging
            them to the console.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I didn't really have any problems with this lab everything went
            well.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This lab was pretty straight forward. The thing I learned the most
            was JQuery because I have never used it before and it truly does
            make writing to HTML a lot easier from javascript
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <div id="base-output">The original array is:</div>
          <div id="square-output">The array squared is:</div>
          <div id="cubed-output">The array cubed is:</div>
