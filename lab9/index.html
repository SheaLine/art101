        <div class="minor-section" id="challenge">
          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge of this lab was to create a button that would change
            the style of the section that it is in using JQuery.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section" id="problems">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            I didn't have many problems with this lab, I originally accessed the
            parent of the button by doing this:
            "this.parentElement.classList.toggle("special");", but after reading
            the rest of the assignment I learned you could do this:
            "$(this).parent().toggleClass("special");" which seems shorter and
            easier to understand, so I changed it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section" id="reflection">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            This lab was pretty straight forward for me, I was able to get it
            done in a short amount of time. I learned a more abut JQuery and how
            to access certain elements in the DOM. I also used this lab to
            enhance my css, by making my buttons a little more interesting. I
            enjoyed figuring out how to use DRY when writing my js.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section" id="results">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <div class="output">Nothing is special.<br /></div>
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <button onclick="location.href='../index.html'">Home</button>
          </li>
