          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            This lab we used functions to sort an array of characters, join them
            back into a string, and then print the string out on our page.

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest problem I had was shuffling the characters, I want it to
            be as random as possible, but that is not easy to do on a computer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I think this lab went good. I enjoyed trying to figure out the bonus
            questions. I think I learned a bit more about css when I was trying
            to make the hello my name is card. I also learned about different
            string and array manipulation methods when trying to shuffle the
            names.
          </p>
