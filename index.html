          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Shea Line and I am from Northern California. I will be
            earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University
            of California, Santa Cruz in June 2025. I have a passion for
            building all things technology, from software engineering to UI/UX.
            I love learning how to harness the power of computers to solve real
            world problems. I am eager to bring my abilities to a forward
            thinking team that demands my strong organizational and analytical
            skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my love of technology, I am interested in the
            outdoors. I love to backpack, camp, hike, and snowboard. I think
            that the best stories I have ever been told have been around a
            campfire, so I decided to tell mine around a virtual one that I
            created. Despite my admiration for tech, being able to connect
            outside of technology is something that I am very passionate about.
            I believe a campfire is the best way to do that. I want my career to
            be dedicated to continuing to tell these stories through technology,
            whether that be an application, a video game, or AI.
