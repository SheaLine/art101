          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge for this lab was to start thinking about how you would
            program something using javascript. Programs are just a collection
            of very precise instructions and this lab helps us form these
            instruction.

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>
            The biggest problem that occurred for me this lab was realizing that
            I was calculating the timezone difference of spain to santa cruz
            wrong this whole time, so I was essentially turning this assignment
            in late without knowing. I have programming experience, so writing
            the pseudocode was not too difficult for me.
          </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>
            I think that this assignment went pretty well. I have programmed a
            rock paper scissors program before in C++ as well as a tic-tac-toe
            game, so I have experience when thinking about how to complete these
            tasks. It has been a long time though so I guess the hardest part
            was remembering how I can achieve a working program. In my
            experience it is always best to start with pseudocode to get your
            thoughts on paper before you start to write code.
